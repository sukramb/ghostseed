# API Service (Ghostseed)

This is the backend service (planned: Node.js/Express on Railway).

## Local Development (placeholder)
- Install dependencies and run the API once the service is scaffolded.
- Environment: see `.env.example` in this directory.

## Notes
- Validate all inputs at the boundary; reject invalid payloads.
- Enforce authentication/authorization and tenant scoping on each request.
